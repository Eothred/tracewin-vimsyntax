TraceWin Syntax File
--------------------

Usage:
You can install this file manually
or (recommended), use [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim):

```
Plugin 'https://bitbucket.org/eothred/tracewin-vimsyntax.git'
```

In either case, you need to recognize the right formats by adding to ~/.vimrc:
```
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.dat setf tracewin
```
